# Admin API Roles & Permissions

This document describes the roles recognized by the Admin API (`/api/{version}/admin/...`)
and the permissions each role grants.

## Overview

Every Admin API request is authenticated with an API key (`sk-Xnai-...`) passed in the
`Authorization: Bearer` header, and every endpoint is protected by the
`AdminEndpointAuthPolicy` authorization policy.

Authentication and authorization happen in two stages:

1. **`AdminEndpointAuthenticationHandler`** validates the API key, looks up the key owner's
   roles, and resolves the target tenant.
2. **`ValidAdminEndpointAccessHandler`** (the policy requirement) confirms the resolved
   context carries an admin role.

Both stages delegate role/tenant resolution to **`AdminRoleTenantResolver`**, which is the
single source of truth for who may call the Admin API.

> **Key rule:** Only callers whose API key owner holds the **`SysAdmin`** or **`TenantAdmin`**
> role can use the Admin API. Access is granted by an *explicit* role assignment only —
> email-domain matching is intentionally **not** used to grant admin access.
>
> API key `CreatedBy` may be either the user's GUID (`user_id`) or their email. Resolution
> looks up by `user_id` first, then by email for legacy keys, and always sets
> `LoggedInUser` to the canonical GUID.

## System Roles

All roles are defined in `Shared/Auth/SystemRoles.cs`:

| Role | Constant | Admin API caller? |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| System Administrator | `SysAdmin` | **Yes** |
| Tenant Administrator | `TenantAdmin` | **Yes** |
| Tenant Participant Admin | `TenantParticipantAdmin` | No |
| Tenant Participant | `TenantParticipant` | No |
| Tenant User | `TenantUser` | No |

Only the first two grant access to the Admin API. The remaining three are roles that admins
*assign to and manage on* users through the Admin API; on their own they cannot call any
Admin API endpoint.

> **"No" means "not an Admin API caller" — not "unimportant".** `TenantParticipantAdmin`,
> `TenantParticipant`, and `TenantUser` are first-class, **backend-enforced role constants**,
> not free-form strings. The platform branches on their exact values in several places, so
> they must always be referenced via the `SystemRoles` constants (never string literals):
>
> - **WebApi authorization policies** — e.g. `WebApiConfiguration` / `AuthConfigurationExtensions`
>   call `RequireRole(SysAdmin, TenantAdmin, TenantUser)`.
> - **Effective-role computation** — `RoleCacheService` deliberately excludes
>   `TenantParticipant` and `TenantParticipantAdmin` when resolving admin roles.
> - **Privilege ordering & normalization** — `TenantParticipantUserService` and
>   `AdminParticipantsEndpoints` rank roles `TenantAdmin > TenantUser > TenantParticipantAdmin
>   > TenantParticipant`.
> - **Repository queries** — `UserRepository` filters tenant memberships by these role values.
> - **Defaults** — every auth provider (Keycloak, OIDC, AzureB2C, GitHub) assigns
>   `TenantUser` as the default role when no tenant is supplied.
> - **Validation allow-lists** — `UserTenantService` validates an incoming role against
>   `{ TenantAdmin, TenantUser, TenantParticipant, TenantParticipantAdmin }`.
>
> They are stored as `const string` (not an `enum`) on purpose: the values are persisted in
> tenant role lists and emitted as `ClaimTypes.Role` claims, so they must serialize cleanly to
> the database and to JWTs without an enum↔string mapping layer.

## Roles That Grant Admin API Access

### `SysAdmin` — System Administrator

- **Tenant scope: any tenant.** A SysAdmin may target any tenant by supplying a `tenantId`
  (resolved from query string, route value, or the `X-Tenant-Id` header, in that priority
  order). `AdminRoleTenantResolver` validates that the tenant exists and locks the request
  context to it. If no `tenantId` is supplied, the SysAdmin's own API-key tenant is used.
- **Inherits all `TenantAdmin` permissions**, scoped to whichever tenant is targeted.
- **Exclusive (SysAdmin-only) operations** — these are gated with
  `AdminTenantScopeGuard.IsSysAdmin(...)` or a direct `SysAdmin` role check and return
  `403 Forbidden` for any other role:
  - **Tenant lifecycle** (`AdminTenantEndpoints`): list, get, create, update, delete tenants.
    Note that the **tenant branding** operations (theme and logo management — see below) are
    *not* SysAdmin-only; they are scoped per tenant and a `TenantAdmin` may use them on their
    own tenant.
  - **Global user management** (`AdminGlobalUserEndpoints`): list/get/patch/delete users
    platform-wide, set the SysAdmin flag, and set user status.
  - **Cross-tenant participant lookup** (`AdminParticipantsEndpoints`): look up a participant
    and their tenant memberships across all tenants.
  - **Cross-tenant template operations** (`AdminTemplateEndpoints`): the create/update/delete
    and cross-tenant read paths.
  - **Ownership-based resources** (e.g. knowledge): can modify any resource regardless of
    ownership.

### `TenantAdmin` — Tenant Administrator

- **Tenant scope: own tenant only.** A TenantAdmin is locked to the tenant of their API key.
  If they pass a `tenantId` that does not match their key's tenant, the request is rejected
  (`"Tenant ID does not match API key tenant"`).
- **Permissions within their own tenant** include managing:
  - Tenant participant users (`AdminUserEndpoints`)
  - Tenant branding — theme and logo (`AdminTenantEndpoints`, see below)
  - Tenant OIDC token-acceptance configuration (`AdminTenantEndpoints`, see below)
  - Agents, agent deployment, and activation
  - Knowledge entries
  - Schedules, tasks, and workflows
  - API keys and secret vault entries
  - Messaging, app integrations, logs, metrics, and stats
- **Cannot** perform any of the SysAdmin-only operations listed above (e.g. creating or
  deleting tenants, global user management, or cross-tenant participant lookup).

## Tenant Scope Enforcement (IDOR Protection)

Because the tenant used during authentication can come from a query string or header while
endpoint handlers bind `tenantId` from the route path, a caller could otherwise authenticate
against their own tenant while pointing the route at a different (victim) tenant.

To close this cross-tenant IDOR vector, routes nested under `/tenants/{tenantId}` apply the
**`TenantRouteScopeFilter`** endpoint filter (backed by
`AdminTenantScopeGuard.RouteMatchesContext`). It rejects any request whose route `tenantId`
does not match the authoritative resolved context tenant, returning:

```json
{ "message": "Tenant scope mismatch" }
```

with HTTP `403 Forbidden`.

For workflow-scoped routes, `AdminTenantScopeGuard.WorkflowIdBelongsToContext` performs the
equivalent check by verifying the tenant segment of the workflow ID
(`{tenantId}:{agent}:{workflowType}[:{activation}]`).

## Ownership-Based Permissions

For resources that track ownership (such as knowledge tied to a deployed agent), there is a
permission tier *below* admin. The effective check (see
`AdminKnowledgeEndpoints.CanModifyAgentResource`) is:

| Caller | Can modify |
|--------|-----------|
| `SysAdmin` | Any resource in any tenant |
| `TenantAdmin` | All resources in their tenant |
| Resource owner | Only resources they own (`OwnerAccess` contains their user ID) |

## Roles Assigned to Managed Users

When an admin creates or updates a tenant user via `AdminUserEndpoints`, the `role` field may
be any tenant role:

- `TenantAdmin`
- `TenantUser`
- `TenantParticipant`
- `TenantParticipantAdmin`

`TenantParticipant` is the default role assigned to a non-SysAdmin user. Assigning these roles
does **not** grant the user Admin API access unless the assigned role is `TenantAdmin` (or the
user is flagged as `SysAdmin`).

## Tenant Branding (Theme & Logo) Endpoints

`AdminTenantEndpoints` exposes dedicated endpoints for managing a tenant's branding. Unlike
the tenant lifecycle endpoints (create/update/delete), these are **tenant-scoped, not
SysAdmin-only**: access is enforced by `ITenantService` (`EnsureTenantAccessOrThrow`), so a
`SysAdmin` may manage any tenant and a `TenantAdmin` may manage their **own** tenant.

All routes are relative to the versioned admin prefix `/api/v{version}/admin/tenants`.

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/{tenantId}/theme` | Returns the tenant's theme: `{ "theme": "<value-or-null>" }`. |
| `PUT` | `/{tenantId}/theme` | Sets/replaces the theme. Body: `{ "theme": "<value>" }`. |
| `DELETE` | `/{tenantId}/theme` | Clears the theme. |
| `GET` | `/{tenantId}/logo` | Serves the logo image (redirects for URL logos, streams bytes for base64). |
| `PUT` | `/{tenantId}/logo` | Sets/replaces the logo. Body is a `Logo` object. |
| `DELETE` | `/{tenantId}/logo` | Removes the logo. |

**Theme** is a short identifier (max 50 chars, `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]`). An empty or whitespace value
is treated as "no theme".

**Logo** accepts *either* an external `url` *or* a base64 image (`imgBase64`) — never both —
plus the required `width` and `height`:

```json
{
  "url": "https://cdn.example.com/logo.png",
  "width": 200,
  "height": 80
}
```

To keep responses small, a stored base64 logo is never echoed back: `PUT /{tenantId}/logo`
returns the logo as a `url` pointing at the `GET /{tenantId}/logo` endpoint instead of the raw
base64 payload.

## Tenant OIDC Configuration Endpoints

`AdminTenantEndpoints` also lets admins manage a tenant's **per-tenant OIDC token-acceptance
configuration** — the rules that govern which external OIDC-issued tokens are accepted for that
tenant's User API interactions (consumed by `DynamicOidcValidator`). These mirror the WebApi
`OidcConfigEndpoints` but are tenant-scoped via the route.

These endpoints are **SysAdmin-only** (OIDC provider acceptance is a platform-level security
control). They are nested under `/tenants/{tenantId}/oidc-config` and protected by both
**`SysAdminOnlyFilter`** and **`TenantRouteScopeFilter`**. All routes are relative to
`/api/v{version}/admin`.

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/tenants/{tenantId}/oidc-config` | Returns the tenant's OIDC config, or `null` when none exists. |
| `POST` | `/tenants/{tenantId}/oidc-config` | Creates/replaces the config (upsert). Body is the config JSON. |
| `PUT` | `/tenants/{tenantId}/oidc-config` | Creates/replaces the config (upsert). Body is the config JSON. |
| `DELETE` | `/tenants/{tenantId}/oidc-config` | Removes the config. |
| `GET` | `/tenants/{tenantId}/oidc-config/template` | Returns a sample config (with `tenantId` pre-filled) to use as a starting point. |

The request body matches the schema validated by `TenantOidcConfigService` (1–5 providers, each
requiring an `issuer`). The route `tenantId` is authoritative: the server forces the payload's
`tenantId` to the route value, so callers never need to set it and cannot point a config at a
different tenant.

> **Persistence depends on the auth provider of the host.** Per-tenant OIDC configs are stored
> encrypted by the DB-backed `TenantOidcConfigService`. When the WebApi host runs with
> `AuthProvider:Provider = "Oidc"`, `ITenantOidcConfigService` is overridden by the read-only
> `StaticOidcConfigService`, and writes return `400 Bad Request` ("not supported") — identical to
> the existing WebApi OIDC endpoints. For all other auth providers the DB-backed service is used
> and writes persist normally.

### Template endpoint rationale

The management UI previously hard-coded the example/template configuration string. The
`GET .../oidc-config/template` endpoint centralizes that template on the server (kept in sync with
the validated schema) so clients can fetch a starting point instead of duplicating it.

## Failure Responses

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Missing / malformed API key (not `sk-Xnai-...`) | `401 Unauthorized` |
| Valid key, but owner lacks `SysAdmin`/`TenantAdmin` | `401 Unauthorized` (`"User does not have required admin role"`) |
| TenantAdmin targets a different tenant than their key | `401 Unauthorized` (`"Tenant ID does not match API key tenant"`) |
| SysAdmin targets a non-existent tenant | `404 Not Found` (`TenantNotFoundException`) |
| Route `tenantId` does not match resolved context tenant | `403 Forbidden` (`"Tenant scope mismatch"`) |
| Authenticated admin calls a SysAdmin-only endpoint without `SysAdmin` | `403 Forbidden` |
